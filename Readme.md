# Assignment: Deploying and Managing a Scalable Web Application Using Kubernetes

## Task Overview
I was assigned the task of **Deploying and Managing a Scalable Web Application Using Kubernetes**. However, due to technical limitations, I was unable to fully implement the Kubernetes deployment.

## What I Accomplished
- **I successfully dockerized the application** and ensured it was containerized correctly.
- Attempted multiple debugging methods to resolve the Kubernetes issue.

## Challenges Faced
- **Kubernetes was not working on my system** despite multiple installation attempts.
- **Docker Desktop was not opening on my system**, preventing further container orchestration.
- Exhaustively tried debugging using:
  - GPT, DeepSeek, Claude
  - Stack Overflow and various other technical forums  

## Determination and Outcome
I was determined to complete this project alone and gained valuable hands-on experience with **Docker and troubleshooting complex issues**. While Kubernetes deployment wasn’t possible this time, I learned a lot about containerization and debugging.  

This experience has strengthened my problem-solving skills, and I’m excited to apply these learnings in future projects!
